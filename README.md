The Assignment Manager is a little checklist tool I created to keep track of assignments and their completion status.

It lets users sort assignments by name, class, due date, and grade weight to work out their plan of attack. It also lets them attach links to resources that are related to that assignment, which they can use as a sort of temporary bookmarks to quickly get setup and start working on assignments.


They can also open CMD for resources. When it's a folder, it will run "git status" automatically. If its a file, it runs "git log --name-only". If it's an web link it pings it.
